# Mapping_Earthquakes

The Disaster Reporting Network, a nonprofit company that provides data driven story telling on disasters around the world, has requested an interactive map using GeoJSON earthquake data. The company’s goal is to make earthquake maps informative and easy to use on a desktop or mobile phone to generate interest in the Disaster Reporting Network.

## Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data 

#### The Disaster Reporting Network has requested adding tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data using JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and GeoJSON data. The following map displays earthquake data and tectonic plate data when the page loads:

## Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data

#### The company has also requested that major earthquake data be added to the map as a third layer group. To do this, we’ll set the radius of the circle markers based on the magnitude of the earthquake as well as add a popup marker for earch earthquake that displace the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer.

## Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map

#### To complete this project, we’ve been asked to add a third map style to the earthquake map.
